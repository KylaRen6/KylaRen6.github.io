    <h2><em>a poem</em></h2>
        <br>
    <p>
<strong>Why</strong> is it<br>That our bodies hold each other so well?<br>Hands fit into hands<br><br>Perfectly,<br><br><em>Comfortably</em><br>We can hug each other and it is <strong>easy</strong><br><br>Our bones are made from<br><br> 
Hard,<br><br><em>Sharp</em><br><br><br><strong>Calcium</strong><br><br><br><br>(So are some stars)<br><br>
But the bodies around them are soft
Good for holding, good for comfort<br><br>
<strong>Contact</strong> is sustenance
For some a boon worth <em>years</em> of searching
Others find it easily<br><br>
Touch is simple, natural and nonthreatening,<br><br>
Or a rare, caught breath that floats over eggshells<br><br>
<em>Why is it</em>
That it hurts so much to be lonely?
<strong>Hands</strong> fit into hands<br><br>
Tentatively,<br><br> 
<strong>Hopefully</strong><br><br>
<em>We were crafted by the gods to comfort one another</em>
